GUI and CLI have similar functions, but they each require a specific way to use them. GUI stands for “graphical user interface,” which allows users to interact with computer functions using visual tools rather than text. GLI elements consist of buttons, files, images, menus, and documents, and other features that resemble real life objects and concepts that are represented digitally to make it easier to understand and use. It is more common for beginner programmers due to the references to real objects that users already know and can use context clues for. CLI stands for “command line interface.” CLI relies on the keyboard, using text and shortcuts in order to interact with computer functions, which can make manipulating directories and files quicker than using GUI. Rather than manually clicking each tool to find a specific file or image, CLI allows the user to type one keyword into the interface and the computer will automatically direct to it. To get to this point the user needs to know the keywords to use, but after that step CLI can be much more efficient. Both of these interface methods can be used hand-in-hand to maximize both efficiency and understanding.
