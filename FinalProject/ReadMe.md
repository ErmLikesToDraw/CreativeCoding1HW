This is my final project.
It's not super flashy in terms of coding, but before this class, I had never touched code in my life. 
I did a LOT of attempts for this, starting and scrapping hours worth of code that was just not working out.
This course has been a huge struggle for me, but I came away from it knowing so much more than I thought I would.
This is just a simple interactive animation, but I wanted to make something visually striking and tied to my own personal goals in art.
Thank you!
