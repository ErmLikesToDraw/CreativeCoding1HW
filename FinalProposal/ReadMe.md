Being in a media arts major, I wanted my final project to reflect my desired career path: animation. 
My proposal is to make an animated loop of a dragon flying, using only simple shapes like we have created before in class. I do not want it to look simple; I want it to look like an animation I would do in a drawing software, only for this I will only use code. 
This will be a very large-scale version of our animated self-portrait. It will have line and color, and will be animated by moving each piece around fluently to look like it is one moving form.
I have already mapped out how I am going about this in a regular animation software with my normal drawing tools, and am now in the tedious process of animating each piece. 
Throughout this final week, all I will need to do is spend each day putting the pieces together, hopefully already knowing where each one needs to be due to my mapped out animation.
I will need to do some research for efficiency more than anything. Any new tools that can be used to speed up the process and make the code itself less cluttered will be used.
