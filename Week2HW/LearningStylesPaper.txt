Are Learning Styles Important?
        While it is true there are a few categories to group people in based on how they learn, I think everyone’s experience with learning is different. 
The article by Cindi May stated that recent studies show learning preferences barely matter when looking at average scores when students are in their element or not. However, I think learning styles are not about the final score- instead, learning styles give an idea of what environment a student actually enjoys being around. Final results do matter, yes, but the actual experience is also important to make sure the student enjoyed learning about the subject. For example, I would consider myself a very visual learner. It takes me a long, unenjoyable time to slog through textbooks even though I do generally get good grades in reading-heavy classes. However, I am focusing my career on art, something very visual. The recommended test we took also showed that I am a visual learner in what I enjoy and what gets in the way of my focus. So although it may not affect my grades in the long run, visual classes are the ones I will continue to come back to. 
        I do believe fun and enjoyment is one of if not the most important part of a learning experience. If I don’t have fun, I won’t want to return to the subject if I don’t have to. This is where the learning styles should be taken into consideration for each student.
